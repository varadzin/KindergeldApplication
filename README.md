# Kindergeld App

The Kindergeld application helps applicants for child benefits in Germany, especially foreigners working in Germany, correctly fill out the required forms. It guides them through the entire application process in a simple manner and explains complex questions found in the application. The result of the completed application will be a PDF File, that the user can print and send, or directly submit the application electronically from the app. 
The App is not done yet, I am developing it now ....
